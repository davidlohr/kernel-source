Subject: [PATCH] media: cec: make cec_get_edid_spa_location() an inline
 function
Git-commit: b915bf575d5b7774d0f22d57d6c143e07dcaade2
References: git-fixes
Patch-mainline: v4.20-rc1

This function is needed by both V4L2 and CEC, so move this to
cec.h as a static inline since there are no obvious shared
modules between the two subsystems.

This patch, together with the following ones, fixes a
dependency bug: if CEC_CORE is disabled, then building adv7604
(and other HDMI receivers) will fail because an essential
function is now stubbed out.
