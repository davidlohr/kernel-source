Subject: [PATCH 14/22] arm64: proton-pack: Report Spectre-BHB vulnerabilities
 as part of Spectre-v2

Git-commit: dee435be76f4117410bbd90573a881fd33488f37
Git-repo: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git
Patch-mainline: Queued in a subsystem tree
References: bsc#1191580 CVE-2022-0001 CVE-2022-000 CVE-2022-23960

Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors can
make use of branch history to influence future speculation as part of
a spectre-v2 attack. This is not mitigated by CSV2, meaning CPUs that
previously reported 'Not affected' are now moderately mitigated by CSV2.

Update the value in /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2
to also show the state of the BHB mitigation.
