Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: clear buf_in_tr when ending a transaction in
 sweep_bh_for_rgrps
Git-commit: f0b444b349e33ae0d3dd93e25ca365482a5d17d4
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: git-fixes

In function sweep_bh_for_rgrps, which is a helper for punch_hole,
it uses variable buf_in_tr to keep track of when it needs to commit
pending block frees on a partial delete that overflows the
transaction created for the delete. The problem is that the
variable was initialized at the start of function sweep_bh_for_rgrps
but it was never cleared, even when starting a new transaction.

This patch reinitializes the variable when the transaction is
ended, so the next transaction starts out with it cleared.
