Subject: [PATCH] ext4: avoid unaccounted block allocation when expanding inode
Git-commit: 8994d11395f8165b3deca1971946f549f0822630
Patch-mainline: v6.2-rc1
References: bsc#1207634

When expanding inode space in ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea() we may need
to allocate external xattr block. If quota is not initialized for the
inode, the block allocation will not be accounted into quota usage. Make
sure the quota is initialized before we try to expand inode space.
