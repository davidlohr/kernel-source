Subject: arm64: hibernate: Clean the __hyp_text to PoC after resume
Git-commit: f7daa9c8fd191724b9ab9580a7be55cd1a67d799
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc5
References: git-fixes

During resume hibernate restores all physical memory. Any memory
that is accessed with the MMU disabled needs to be cleaned to the
PoC.

KVMs __hyp_text was previously ommitted as it runs with the MMU
enabled, but now that the hyp-stub is located in this section,
we must clean __hyp_text too.

This ensures secondary CPUs that come online after hibernate
has finished resuming, and load KVM via the freshly written
hyp-stub see the correct instructions.
