Subject: arm64: futex: Avoid copying out uninitialised stack in failed
 cmpxchg()
Git-commit: 8e4e0ac02b449297b86498ac24db5786ddd9f647
Patch-mainline: v5.2-rc1
References: git-fixes

Returning an error code from futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() indicates
that the caller should not make any use of *uval, and should instead act
upon on the value of the error code. Although this is implemented
correctly in our futex code, we needlessly copy uninitialised stack to
*uval in the error case, which can easily be avoided.
