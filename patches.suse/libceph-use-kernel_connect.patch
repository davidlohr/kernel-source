Subject: libceph: use kernel_connect()
Git-commit: 7563cf17dce0a875ba3d872acdc63a78ea344019
Patch-mainline: v6.6-rc6
References: bsc#1219446

Direct calls to ops->connect() can overwrite the address parameter when
used in conjunction with BPF SOCK_ADDR hooks. Recent changes to
kernel_connect() ensure that callers are insulated from such side
effects. This patch wraps the direct call to ops->connect() with
kernel_connect() to prevent unexpected changes to the address passed to
ceph_tcp_connect().

This change was originally part of a larger patch targeting the net tree
addressing all instances of unprotected calls to ops->connect()
throughout the kernel, but this change was split up into several patches
targeting various trees.
