Subject: uprobes/x86: Fix detection of 32-bit user mode
Git-commit: 9212ec7d8357ea630031e89d0d399c761421c83b
Patch-mainline: 5.3-rc7
References: git-fixes

32-bit processes running on a 64-bit kernel are not always detected
correctly, causing the process to crash when uretprobes are installed.

The reason for the crash is that in_ia32_syscall() is used to determine the
process's mode, which only works correctly when called from a syscall.

In the case of uretprobes, however, the function is called from a exception
and always returns 'false' on a 64-bit kernel. In consequence this leads to
corruption of the process's return address.

Fix this by using user_64bit_mode() instead of in_ia32_syscall(), which
is correct in any situation.

[ tglx: Add a comment and the following historical info ]

This should have been detected by the rename which happened in commit

  abfb9498ee13 ("x86/entry: Rename is_{ia32,x32}_task() to in_{ia32,x32}_syscall()")

which states in the changelog:

    The is_ia32_task()/is_x32_task() function names are a big misnomer: they
    suggests that the compat-ness of a system call is a task property, which
    is not true, the compatness of a system call purely depends on how it
    was invoked through the system call layer.
    .....

and then it went and blindly renamed every call site.

Sadly enough this was already mentioned here:

   8faaed1b9f50 ("uprobes/x86: Introduce sizeof_long(), cleanup adjust_ret_addr() and
arch_uretprobe_hijack_return_addr()")

where the changelog says:

    TODO: is_ia32_task() is not what we actually want, TS_COMPAT does
    not necessarily mean 32bit. Fortunately syscall-like insns can't be
    probed so it actually works, but it would be better to rename and
    use is_ia32_frame().

and goes all the way back to:

    0326f5a94dde ("uprobes/core: Handle breakpoint and singlestep exceptions")

Oh well. 7+ years until someone actually tried a uretprobe on a 32bit
process on a 64bit kernel....
