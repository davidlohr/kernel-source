Subject: [PATCH] fs: fix guard_bio_eod to check for real EOD errors
Git-commit: dce30ca9e3b676fb288c33c1f4725a0621361185
Patch-mainline: v5.1-rc1
References: bsc#1213042

guard_bio_eod() can truncate a segment in bio to allow it to do IO on
odd last sectors of a device.

It already checks if the IO starts past EOD, but it does not consider
the possibility of an IO request starting within device boundaries can
contain more than one segment past EOD.

In such cases, truncated_bytes can be bigger than PAGE_SIZE, and will
underflow bvec->bv_len.

Fix this by checking if truncated_bytes is lower than PAGE_SIZE.

This situation has been found on filesystems such as isofs and vfat,
which doesn't check the device size before mount, if the device is
smaller than the filesystem itself, a readahead on such filesystem,
which spans EOD, can trigger this situation, leading a call to
zero_user() with a wrong size possibly corrupting memory.

I didn't see any crash, or didn't let the system run long enough to
check if memory corruption will be hit somewhere, but adding
instrumentation to guard_bio_end() to check truncated_bytes size, was
enough to see the error.

The following script can trigger the error.

MNT=/mnt
IMG=./DISK.img
DEV=/dev/loop0

mkfs.vfat $IMG
mount $IMG $MNT
cp -R /etc $MNT &> /dev/null
umount $MNT

losetup -D

losetup --find --show --sizelimit 16247280 $IMG
mount $DEV $MNT

find $MNT -type f -exec cat {} + >/dev/null

Kudos to Eric Sandeen for coming up with the reproducer above
